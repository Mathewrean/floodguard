# Problem Context

## Overview

Flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters worldwide, causing significant loss of life, property damage, and economic disruption. In the United States alone, floods account for an average of $8 billion in damages annually, with over 100 deaths per year. Climate change exacerbates this issue by increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heavy rainfall and storm surges.

## Key Challenges

- **Early Warning Systems**: Many communities lack timely and accurate flood warnings, leading to inadequate preparation and response.
- **Data Integration**: Flood prediction relies on diverse data sources (weather forecasts, river gauges, satellite imagery), but these are often siloed and not easily accessible.
- **Community Engagement**: Residents and local authorities need better tools for reporting incidents and coordinating responses.
- **Scalability**: Solutions must work across different geographic scales, from local neighborhoods to entire counties.

## Current Gaps

- Limited real-time data sharing between agencies and communities.
- Inadequate visualization tools for flood risk assessment.
- Lack of personalized alerts based on individual risk profiles.
- Insufficient community-driven reporting mechanisms.

## Impact

Without effective flood management systems, communities face:

- Increased vulnerability to flood events.
- Higher economic costs from damages and recovery.
- Reduced public trust in emergency management systems.
- Challenges in adapting to climate change impacts.

This project aims to address these challenges by developing an integrated flood monitoring and alert system that leverages modern technologies for proactive risk management.
