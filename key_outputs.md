# Key Outputs

## Project Name

**FloodGuard**: An AI-Powered Flood Monitoring and Alert System

## Mission Statement

To empower communities with real-time flood intelligence, enabling proactive protection against flood disasters through integrated monitoring, predictive analytics, and community-driven response coordination.

## Vision

A world where no community is caught unprepared for flooding, leveraging cutting-edge technology to save lives, protect property, and build resilient communities.

## User Stories

### Emergency Management Officials

1. As a county emergency manager, I want to receive real-time flood alerts so that I can coordinate response efforts effectively.
2. As an emergency coordinator, I want to access county-wide flood risk dashboards so that I can make informed decisions about resource allocation.
3. As a public safety official, I want to integrate FloodGuard with existing emergency management systems so that I can streamline operations.

### Local Residents

4. As a homeowner in a flood-prone area, I want to receive personalized flood risk alerts so that I can protect my property.
5. As a community member, I want to report local flooding conditions so that I can contribute to community awareness.
6. As a resident, I want to access easy-to-understand flood maps so that I can understand my personal risk.

### Community Leaders

7. As a neighborhood coordinator, I want to organize volunteer response efforts so that I can support vulnerable residents.
8. As a community leader, I want to access aggregated community reports so that I can identify emerging flood patterns.
9. As a volunteer coordinator, I want to communicate with other leaders so that I can coordinate multi-neighborhood responses.

### First Responders

10. As a first responder, I want real-time situational awareness so that I can prioritize response efforts.
11. As an emergency services worker, I want access to flood-specific protocols so that I can respond appropriately.
12. As a field responder, I want to update incident status in real-time so that I can keep command centers informed.
